				<h1>Background</h1>
				<p>Deftones is an American alternative metal band from Sacramento, California, formed in 1988,
					consisting of
					Chino Moreno (lead vocals and guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Sergio Vega (bass), Frank Delgado
					(keyboards and turntables), and Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion). Vega (formerly of Quicksand)
					took
					on bass duties in mid-2009 in substitution for Chi Cheng, who was seriously injured in an automobile
					accident in Santa Clara, California on November 4, 2008. Cheng remained in a coma until his death on
					April 13, 2013 due to cardiac arrest.</p>


				<p>While they were mostly an alternative metal band in their early years, their sound changed into
					something
					more complex and experimental in 2000, as a result they are often coined today as an alternative
					rock
					band.</p>

				<p>Critics have often praised them as one of the closest to unique rock bands of recent years for their
					innovative, atmospheric music; as Johnny Loftus writes, "Rock critics usually reserve a special
					place
					for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement Deftones
					have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like dream
					pop
					and DC hardcore into their Northern California alt-metal."</p>

				<p>Frontman Chino Moreno’s poetic lyrics—described by a Time magazine critic as “fiercely
					intelligent”—are
					often evocative, yet are sparse enough to allow for multiple interpretations. Moreno has cited
					Morrissey, Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo, The Cure’s Robert Smith, and Depeche Mode’s David Gahan among his
					favorite singers, and beyond an occasional similarity in vocal technique, these singers’ sweeping
					sense
					of drama and delicate vulnerability is often evident in Moreno’s vocals.</p>

				<p>Deftones members have worked on several side projects, including Moreno’s Team Sleep and drummer Abe
					Cunningam’s Phallucy. Guitarist Stephen Carpenter works with a group called Kush, featuring members
					of
					Fear Factory and Cypress Hill. Turntablist Frank Delgado has a DJ crew with DJ Crook of Team Sleep,
					DJ
					Julez and Matt D called Decibel Devils.</p>

					<li>Chi Cheng (bass, backing vocals)</li>
					<li>Frank Delgado (turntablist/keyboardist/sampler)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>(Incidentally, Carpenter is generally credited with “strings”, though if he actually plays anything
					other
					than electric guitar it’s not immediately apparent. This most likely refers to his abuse of the
					guitar
					strings, making screeching noises inbetween playing riffs.)</p>
