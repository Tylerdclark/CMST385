				<h2>DEFTONES' STEPHEN CARPENTER Plays Through "Prayers/Triangles"</h2>
				<p class="author">By Greg Kennelty - Feb 20, 2022</p>

				<p>Deftones guitarist Stephen Carpenter is back with a brand new playthrough of the band's 2016 song
					"Prayers/Triangles" off the polarizing Gore record. Which frankly, I'd vouch for any day of the week
					given its atmospheric leanings and overall shift in mood from Koi No Yokan (which is equally great
					for different reasons).
					Regardless, check out the playthrough above and enjoy some Gore.</p>

				<p>Deftones singer Chino Moreno and Far multi-instrumentalist Shaun Lopez have long made music together
					in their electronic/trip-hop side band, ††† (Crosses). Now, the guys have inked a deal with a major
					label, Warner Brother Records, giving a home to their upcoming full-length album.</p>

				<p>Moreno and Lopez have been teasing fans about the upcoming music for several months. The upcoming set
					will mark the duo’s first bit of new music since 2020, when they released a one-off cover of Cause &
					Effect’s “The Beginning of the End,” marking their fist activity in six years.</p>

						Twitter post</a></p>

				<p>Deftones celebrated the 15th anniversary of their fifth LP over the weekend by sharing an alternate
					concept of the Frank Maddocks album cover.

					The (fairly divisive) follow-up to the band's 2003 self-titled record was released via Maverick
					Records on October 31, 2006, and was the last to feature late bassist Chi Cheng.</p>
